francois bozize deposed car leader announces presidential bid
deposed former central african republic president francois bozize announced on saturday his candidacy for the december presidential vote despite being under united nations sanctions and subject to an arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity
he made the announcement in a speech to a large crowd of supporters at a congress of his party kwa na kwa work nothing but work in the capital bangui
the 73yearold former general and army chief was overthrown in a 2013 rebellion by a coalition of mainly muslim rebels from the north plunging the majority christian nation into a violent civil war and an acute and continuing humanitarian crisis
the country needs a man of experience peace and conviction bozize said in the speech that criticised the tenure of the current president faustinarchange touadera
bozize first took power after a 2003 coup and served 10 years as president before fleeing the country in 2013
the new administration sought his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide but has not moved to arrest him since he returned from exile late last year
it is not clear how the warrant or foreign sanctions will affect his candidacy
in january bozize said he would ask the un to lift the sanctions imposed in 2014 over his alleged support for antibalaka christian armed groups
touadera governs today with the support of a large un peacekeeping operation with more than 13000 troops and police
elected in 2016 he is expected to seek a second term in the election but has not yet confirmed he will run
the first round of the race is scheduled for december 27

violence has since generally receded but there are still bloody incidents typically sparked by fighting over resources and most of the diamondrich country remains beyond government control
the violence has forced more than 15 million people to flee their homes
malaysia searches for 24 rohingya feared drowned off island
kuala lumpur malaysia ap  malaysian authorities said sunday that they were searching for two dozen rohingya refugees who are feared to have drowned after jumping off their boat off the northern resort island of langkawi
zawawi abdullah a senior official with the malaysian maritime enforcement agency said initial police information showed that only one of 25 rohingya men who jumped off the boat had managed to swim ashore
the lone survivor sought help from police late saturday and has been detained for further investigation zawawi said
hundreds of thousands of muslim rohingya have fled myanmar due to a military crackdown and many live in densely crowded refugee camps in bangladesh
muslimdominated malaysia has been a common destination of boats arranged by traffickers who promise the refugees a better life abroad
zawawi said two vessels and an aircraft were deployed in the search
he said the agency will also alert local fishermen and authorities in neighboring thailand to assist in the search
he didnt provide further details on the boat
last month malaysian authorities detained 269 rohingya refugees and found a body on board a suspected smuggling boat off langkawi that they said had been intentionally damaged so it couldnt be turned back to sea
the malaysian maritime enforcement agency later said that the 269 were transferred from a larger vessel on which dozens of people were believed to have died and their bodies thrown into the sea
prime minister muhyiddin yassin said malaysia cannot accept any more rohingya refugees as it struggles with an economic slowdown due to the coronavirus pandemic
but he said those already in the country will not be sent back out to sea
malaysia is home to over 2 million illegal immigrants as well as some 180000 refugees and asylum seekers  including 101000 rohingya  who are registered with the un refugee agency
wilfried zaha wants to leave crystal palace says roy hodgson watch this space
crystal palace manager roy hodgson dealt a blow to fans ahead of the closeseason by revealing star attacker wilf zaha wants to leave the club
the ivorian international has been at selhurst park for over five years and now looks set to depart having previously been linked with the likes of arsenal and bayern munich
at age 27 it remains to be seen if that calibre of club are still interested in splashing out a large fee on him particularly this summer with the economic uncertainty in the sport after a campaign in which zaha scored four goals and claimed five assists for a palace side which failed to inspire
speaking postmatch after the final day hodgson told talksports alex crook to watch this space regarding zahas probable exit after acknowledging the forward has made it clear he sees his future away from the club
the forward still has three years left on his current palace deal and they last year suggested it would take 100m to prise him away from the club
hodgsons side wrapped up the campaign with seven straight defeats and a finalday draw dropping to 14th place in the process
zaha himself netted just once between middecember and the end of the season a longrange strike in a defeat to chelsea
he was reported to have handed in a transfer request last summer in a bid to force a move away but a bid didnt materialise to tempt palace to sell
in an apparent move to boost his chances of a departure zaha changed agents in january and his priority for the weeks ahead will clearly be to secure a move away
zaha was the player to feature for the most minutes in the premier league this season for palace and the only member of the squad under 28 years of age to play 1100 minutes or more pointing to the level of rebuild which might be required in the squad with the potential fee brought in for the no 11
ceasefire in wartorn eastern ukraine to begin at midnight
kyiv ukraine  ukrainian and rebel forces in wartorn eastern ukraine have started preparing for a full and comprehensive ceasefire scheduled to begin at midnight a move that officials hope can lead to more steps to resolve the 6yearold conflict
rebel officials said sunday they have instructed their troops about the ceasefire and issued a decree banning the use of weapons
ukraines military said their forces have begun preparations for the ceasefire
if upheld it would pave the way for implementing other clauses of the minsk peace deal the office of ukraines president said earlier this week calling the ceasefire a breakthrough
brokered in 2015 by france and germany the minsk peace plan aimed to resolve the conflict between ukraine and russiabacked separatists that flared in 2014 after russias annexation of crimea and its support for the separatists
the conflict has since killed more than 14000
the presidents of russia and ukraine both commended the ceasefire deal in a phone call sunday and underscored the importance of implementing the agreements reached at the december summit in paris
russia president vladimir putin expressed concern over kyivs calls to revise the minsk agreements and said ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiys position about the nonalternative nature of the minsk agreements once again voiced during this call should translate into real actions the kremlin said
zelenskiy in turn stressed the need for further practical steps aimed at releasing ukrainians who are imprisoned by rebels in eastern ukraine in the annexed region of crimea and in russia according to a statement by his office
the 2015 deal envisaged that ukraine can regain control over its border with russia in the separatistheld regions only after they are granted broad selfrule and hold local elections
the accord helped reduce the scope of hostilities but ukrainian forces and the rebels have continued to exchange artillery salvos and gunfire
in december the leaders of ukraine russia france and germany met in paris for another round of talks expressing support for the minsk deal and agreeing to revive the peace process
zelenskiy who won the 2019 election on promises to end the conflict wanted ukraine to get control of its border first before local elections but the kremlin has insisted the deal should be implemented without revisions
the new ceasefire deal was reached wednesday by members of the tripartite contact group that includes representatives of russia ukraine and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe and was welcomed by eu officials
during his traditional sunday blessing in st peters square pope francis also commended the ceasefire adding that it needed to be put into practice to rebuild confidence and lay the foundations for a much needed and long awaited reconciliation with the people
hunger organization pushes out yoho after capitol incident
washington ap  a nonpartisan christian organization that seeks to end hunger said saturday it asked for and received the resignation of rep ted yoho from its board of directors following what it called his verbal attack on rep alexandria ocasiocortez
ocasiocortez dny accused yoho rfla of using a vulgar and sexist insult while upbraiding her during a confrontation last monday on the steps of the capitol
yoho maintained he did not use the words cited though a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed the language as she described it
in a statement bread for the world said its board met friday with yoho and sought his resignation as an action that reaffirms our commitment to coming alongside women and people of color nationally and globally as they continue to lead us to a more racially inclusive and equitable world
on its website bread for the world says its collective christian voice lobbies congress and the administration on ending hunger nationally and worldwide
as a bipartisan christian organization committed to alleviating hunger and poverty through sound public policies bread for the world upholds the values of respect dignity and compassion that jesus calls us to when engaging decision makers from across the political spectrum the statement said
we believe that rep ted yohos recent actions and words as reported in the media are not reflective of the ethical standards expected of members of our board of directors
a spokesman for yoho did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment
in an extraordinary speech thursday in the house ocasiocortez offered a dramatic account of the incident and broadened her remarks to assail what she called a sexist culture of accepting violence and violent language against women
more than a dozen colleagues joined her in casting the incident as alltoocommon male behavior
yoho has described the encounter as a brief policy discussion and said that no one was accosted bullied or attacked
he expressed regret for his abrupt manner

fdny diversity official says most definitely ok to exclude white firefighter from color guard
an fdny diversity official has said that its most definitely acceptable to keep a white firefighter off a ceremonial color guard so the flag bearers could all be black according to a new report
white firefighter lt daniel mcwilliams filed a lawsuit claiming racial bias after he was removed from a flagbearing unit at a november 2017 memorial mass honoring deceased members of the vulcan society a fraternal society of black firefighters
and fdnys chief diversity and inclusion officer lawyer cecilia loving has defended the decision at a new york state division of human rights trial the new york post reports
mcwilliams was one of the three fdny firefighters seen in an iconic photo as they hoist the american flag at ground zero in the days after the 911 attacks
according to mcwilliams complaint he been selected by the fdny ceremonial unit to serve as one of the flag bearers in the color guard at the memorial service
being a flag bearer at the event was an esteemed honor and privilege for mcwilliams according to his lawsuit cnn reported
upon his arrival at the event however mcwilliams was barred from participating in the color guard by thenvulcan society president regina wilson because she allegedly had asked for an allblack color guard at the mass
she then asked mcwilliams  a 29year fdny veteran  to help in a different capacity
among those duties was allegedly asking him to escort civilians and muster uniformed officers into formation away from the mass
mcwilliams claimed in his suit that he asked wilson if she was removing him from the color guard because hes not black
she confirmed that was the case he said
wilson a 21year fdny veteran who was also part of the 911 rescue efforts apparently replaced mcwilliams with one of the members of the vulcan society
mcwilliams claimed he left the memorial to save himself from further shame humiliation and embarrassment as their exchange was overheard by friends and colleagues the new york daily news reported
during her trial testimony mcwilliams lawyer keith sullivan asked loving  who is black  so a request for an allblack color guard is not discriminatory
no it isnt loving said according to the new york post
sullivan also asked loving if its ok to request an allblack color guard to which she was quoted as saying most definitely
by way of explanation loving said that it was ok to swap out a white person for a black person to uplift our identities and our separate ethnicities in order to instill a sense of pride and community and support for one another
mcwilliams first filed his racial bias complaint with the fdny in january 2018
he then filed a lawsuit against wilson the fdny the city of new york and unnamed individuals in may 2019
after filing his complaint sullivan said that mcwilliams was retaliated against and intimidated by wilsons supporters
at one point one of her supporters allegedly laid hands on mcwilliams and said ive heard about you they told me youd act this way and now you know me
in a brief sullivan wrote that rejecting mcwilliams from the mass color guard position was deplorable and a sign of double standards in the fire department
if youre black and you discriminate against a white person in the workplace you get a slap on the wrist at best sullivan wrote
wilson according to the lawsuit received one hour of counseling over her treatment of mcwilliams
meanwhile a white person who discriminates against a person of color receives heavyhanded discipline and punishment sullivan wrote
the fdny has created a policy and procedure for bending over backwards coming up with excuses and accommodating members of the vulcan society  who commit racist acts and it has to stop sullivan also wrote
serbia seeks more warplanes amid balkan tensions
belgrade serbia ap  serbia will strengthen its armed forces and is seeking to purchase more warplanes amid simmering tensions in the balkans the serbian president said sunday
president aleksandar vucic said certain initiatives have been made to buy a fleet of fighterbombers accusing the us and other western countries of arming serbias nato neighbors and its breakaway former province of kosovo
the americans turks and germans are taking care of their beloved child vucic said referring to kosovo
he said the us has recently delivered a number of armored vehicles to kosovos security forces
during a tour of a serbian army tank brigade vucic said his country cannot compete with nato donations to its neighbors when it comes to weapons therefore we must do it alone
vucic did not specify what type of warplanes serbia plans to buy but the progovernment media said his government has officially asked the us for the delivery of 20 fighterbombers
the reports said washington has not yet responded to belgrades request and that in case of a refusal it is likely to purchase russianmade sukhoi25 attack aircraft
serbia which claims military neutrality has recently received a sophisticated antiaircraft system from russia which has also provided fighter jets attack helicopters and armored vehicles
another serbian ally china has delivered military drones
us officials have in the past spoken openly about introducing sanctions against serbia if moscow sends more arms to the country especially those that could jeopardize the security of neighboring natomember states
the russian and chinese arming of serbia is being watched with unease in the west and among serbias neighbors
tensions are growing in the balkans which went through a devastating civil war in the 1990s
nato intervened in serbia to stop a bloody serb crackdown against kosovo albanian separatists in 1999
despite formally seeking to join the european union serbias populist leadership has further strengthened close political and military ties with the kremlin as well as beijing
serbia as well as russia and china dont accept kosovos independence which is recognized by the us and most of the west
history focus can play an important role in reconciliation
divides have deepened when understanding and healing should be our goals
our school system is partly to blame for this failure of knowledge and understanding
far too little australian history is taught
in fact without radical action the only school subject that focuses specifically on our history  australian history at year 12  will die within the next five years maybe sooner
last year of 49324 victorian students to complete the vce only 628 or 1 per cent did australian history
over the past six years this figure has been almost halved with almost 100 fewer students enrolling every year
a key reason why so few students choose to study australian history in year 12 is that little has been done in earlier years to fire their passion
history is not even a standalone learning area but is subsumed within the broader humanities
so across years 7 and 8 students complete only one short unit on ancient aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples and culture
then in years 9 and 10 there is another unit focusing on australia during the world wars
for many victorian students that is the sum of australian history taught across their secondary years
at years 9 and 10 there is another optional unit covering the period from 17501918
three actions should urgently be taken to save australian history in victorian schools
first history must become a standalone learning area like english maths and science
because history is taught only as part of the humanities it is given little space within the curriculum
it is also normally taught by humanities generalists who have not studied history themselves
historical skills such as the analysis of evidence are complex
we must recruit more specialist history teachers to make sure these are taught in an accessible and exciting way
third the study of australian history from 1788 to 1914 must become compulsory
students love familiarity
so many of my former students decided against australian history in year 12 because they would have had to learn the content from scratch
knowledge of our history alone will not bridge our deep racial divides
but without it as the victorian curriculum makes clear the task is hopeless

will prince andrew be named in new sex dossier
royal prepares to fight back against possible disclosure in court documents about his friendship with jeffrey epstein and ghislaine maxwell
us judge ordered release of secret documents relating to epstein and maxwell
the 80 pages of documents contain sections of maxwells 2016 testimonies
release of the pages could also heap pressure on prince andrew as they include communications between maxwell and epstein from january 2015
virginia roberts an alleged sex slave of the shamed us financier claimed in 2015 court papers that she was forced to have sex with prince andrew
prince andrew is preparing to fight back against the possible disclosure this week of further damaging allegations about his friendship with paedophile jeffrey epstein and alleged accomplice ghislaine maxwell
us district judge loretta preska last week ordered the release of 80 secret legal documents running to hundreds of pages relating to maxwell and epstein
the publication of the vast tranche of papers would be a blow for maxwell 58 as they feature large sections of testimony she gave to lawyers in 2016 including what her legal team said was intrusive questioning about her sex life
they could also heap pressure on prince andrew because one of the documents includes communications between maxwell and epstein from january 2015 when virginia roberts an alleged sex slave of the shamed us financier claimed in court papers that she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions
andrew has repeatedly and strenuously denied the claims
a leaked email from 2015 that was revealed last year by the bbc appears to suggest that andrew asked for maxwells help in dealing with ms robertss claims
we have no doubt the duke will be vindicated
in it he told the socialite let me know when we can talk  got some specific questions to ask you about virginia roberts
maxwell replied have some info  call me when you have a moment
last night a source close to andrew said the duke of york has done nothing wrong so we are relaxed about the unsealing of any court documents
as the us courts have been at pains to point out just because an allegation is included in court papers does not make them true
the us courts have urged the media and public to treat any allegations contained in court papers with extreme caution
we entirely concur
we have no doubt the duke will be completely vindicated in the weeks ahead
maxwell is being held in manhattans metropolitan detention center awaiting trial for recruiting and grooming some of epsteins underage victims between 1994 and 1997
she is also accused of perjury for denying knowledge in legal depositions of his abuse
she denies all the allegations
maxwell was interviewed by lawyers in april and july 2016 as part of a defamation lawsuit brought by ms roberts who now goes by her married surname giuffre
about 40 of 418 pages of that testimony were made public last year but following last weeks ruling by judge preska in new york further sections could be unsealed as early as thursday
maxwells lawyers were given a week to file an appeal
epstein was found dead in his new york prison cell last year while he was awaiting trial for sex offences

biden campaign declines fox news sunday interview 1 week after chris wallaces trump sitdown
during his interview with chris wallace last week president trump questioned whether the democrats presumptive presidential nominee joe biden could handle the barrage of questioning that wallace posed to trump
the answer to that question  at least for now  we may never know
wallace on sunday informed viewers that the biden campaign told fox news he was not available for an interview
in our interview last week with president trump he questioned whether his democratic opponent joe biden could handle a similar encounter wallace said
this week we asked the biden campaign for an interview and they said the former vice president was not available
he added well keep asking every week
the trump campaign has hit biden for months for abstaining from holding rallies and news conferences while continuing to do interviews amid the coronavirus pandemic
while biden recently has returned to the stump trump and his allies continued to mock the former vice president for hiding in his home in delaware
bidens reticence to do public events however has done little to hurt his candidacy as the latest polls had biden comfortably ahead of trump both nationally and in key battleground states
real clear politics averages indicated the president was down 7 points in florida 67 points in pennsylvania 82 points in michigan and 64 points in wisconsin
trump narrowly won all four states in 2016 flipping them from blue to red as he won the white house
the latest fox news polls put biden ahead in minnesota michigan and pennsylvania with leads all outside the margin of error
polling also suggested biden had a slight edge in ohio north carolina and arizona three other important swing states this cycle
and surveys indicated that once reliably red states such as texas and georgia were all knotted up between trump and the former vice president
presidential elections in which an incumbent is running for a second term in the white house are often a referendum on that president  and thats seen as being the case right now in the 2020 showdown between trump and biden
the top issues have been the coronavirus and an economy flattened by the pandemic  and the presidents performance and record on both issues
aswan villagers collect guard and return crashed chocolate shipment to sudan
a truck loaded with tons of chocolate headed to sudan rolled over on the aswanabu simple international road on sunday in front of wadi karkar village entrance with the driver falling into a coma brought on by heatstroke

the most important thing for us was to save the drivers life protect the shipment and open up the international road he explained
the villagers were more than ready to bring water and shelter the injured driver bahr said adding that all they wanted was to ensure that he would enter and leave the village safely
congress was already broken  the coronavirus could make it worse
the pandemic alone is a call to our elected officials for the type of leadership and vision we expect at a moment of crisis says the report which grew out of interviews conducted by leonard steinhorn a professor of communication at american university and mark sobol an author and expert on organizational development and executive leadership
but we are also facing another reckoning one over our nations original sin and the racial inequities that have beset our country since its founding
the study ticks through familiar themes when it comes to assessing the sorry state of congress the lack of any real acrosstheaisle relationships a schedule that limits opportunities for interaction too much power concentrated in leadership constant fundraising demands discouragement of bipartisanship the negative influence of roundtheclock media the fact that the most important election for lawmakers is often their primary and the shutting out of minorityparty voices
it also warns that the shifts toward a more virtual congress as a result of the pandemic such as a new system of proxy voting in the house that allows lawmakers to cast their votes without traveling to washington could exacerbate the existing problems
if the idea of a remote congress takes hold the report suggests it would be a serious setback to efforts to enhance bipartisan interaction
because of the pandemic congress was forced to conduct much of its business virtually and we certainly understand why the report said
but as much as that may have been a necessity it should not be interpreted as a virtue
the document says congress needs more and not less inperson interaction among members of congress
they need to learn more about each others districts hold civil conversations aimed at finding common ground build relationships of trust that can lead understanding and solutions
in a week when representative alexandria ocasiocortez democrat of new york was verbally assaulted without provocation by representative ted yoho republican of florida and fellow republicans ganged up on representative liz cheney republican of wyoming in a hostile confrontation the call for civility rang especially true

future of north brisbane koala habitat site goes to planning court
the council said as well as being critical koala squirrel glider and grey goshawk habitat it was a key link between cabbage tree creek and albany creek bushland corridors
the property developers have appealed the councils rejection in the planning and environment court arguing the development complies with city plan 2014 legislation would satisfy an unmet town planning and community need and could be undertaken without any unacceptable impacts
strong community opposition persists over the proposed development
the developers while maintaing the proposal is fully compliant with the plan argue it could be changed to avoid any noncompliance rather than refused
the development as it stands involves several stages including a service station childcare centre and 39 townhouses
more than 120 public submissions were made during the consultation period most objecting to the proposal as too big and inappropriate for the site
bcc opposition leader jared cassidy said the council needed to buy the land to protect koalas
lord mayor adrian schrinner needs to stop wasting ratepayer funds in a developer court battle and buy this land to protect brisbanes wildlife cr cassidy said
this is one of the most significant pieces of habitat in the mountain to mangroves corridor and is home to a large koala community
cr schrinner this week said the council wanted to see the koala habitat on the site protected
we didnt believe the proposal was appropriate for the site cr schrinner said
this i understand is now going through a court process and obviously we hope to see out of that court process a good positive outcome which will see the habitat preserved
cr schrinner said koala habitat mapping was a joint responsibility between the council and the state government with the state government responsible for detailed koala mapping used by local authorities for assessing development applications
us reportedly ramps up pressure on nord stream 2 contractors  rt business news
the us government has made further attempts to force european firms to ditch the russianled nord stream 2 gas pipeline project welt am sonntag reported citing people familiar with talks on the issue
according to the newspaper officials from us department of state the treasury department as well as the department of energy approached european contractors to make sure they fully understand the consequences of staying in the project
up to a dozen officials reportedly held at least two online conferences with representatives of the firms in recent days
speaking in a friendly manner the us side stressed that it wanted to prevent completion of nord stream 2 observers of the online talks said
i believe the threat is very very serious one of them revealed to the german outlet
those threats are consistent with comments by us secretary of state mike pompeo last week in which he warned that companies involved in the project had better get out now or risk facing penalties under section 232 of the notorious countering americas adversaries through sanctions act caatsa
apart from russias energy major gazprom which is developing the project five european companies have joined
those are frances engie austrias omv the ukdutch company royal dutch shell as well as wintershall and germanys uniper
speaking to welt am sonntag the latter called us attempts to undermine the important infrastructure project a clear intervention into european sovereignty
earlier this week the us house of representatives approved an amendment to the national defense authorization act meant to expand us sanctions on companies involved in installing russias nord stream 2 gas pipeline
according to one of the sponsors of the bill the measures can target companies facilitating or providing vessels insurance port facilities or tethering services for those vessels as well as to those providing certification for nord stream 2
both european businesses and government officials have repeatedly decried us attempts to meddle in european energy policy by sanctioning nord stream 2 with some even calling on brussels to work on countermeasures
moscow has also lambasted washingtons move calling it unfair competition
earlier this week presidential spokesman dmitry peskov said that russia will develop a new strategy for completion of the project if washington proceeds with new punitive measures

donald trump admits he often regrets his twitter rants
donald trump has admitted he frequently regrets the incendiary posts he makes on twitter
speaking to barstool sports friday the president of the united states admitted that his unchecked retweets  which have included prowhite supremacist material  get him in the most trouble
asked by journalist dave portnoy if he regretted his posts trump answered often too often
it used to be in the old days before this youd write a letter and youd say this letter is very big
you put it on your desk and then you go back tomorrow and you say oh im glad i didnt send it right
but we dont do that with twitter right
we put it out instantaneously we feel great and then you start getting phone calls  did you really say this
i say whats wrong with that and you find out a lot of things
last month trump sparked fury after retweeting sharing content from another account a video of his supporters in the villages area of florida with the elderly pair filmed exclaiming white power
and in 2017 trump retweeted three antimuslim tweets posted by jayda fransen leader of farright fringe political party britain first
the president told portnoy that the retweets that got him in the most trouble
trump said you see something that looks good and you dont investigate it and you dont know whats on the helmet exactly right which is a miniature and you dont blow it up it sometimes  i have found that almost always its the retweets that get you in trouble
the president often shares praise for himself rants about his rivals and conspiracy theories with his 80 million twitter followers
trump says twitter helps him cut through socalled fake news reports on tv shows and newspapers he claims are riddled with falsehoods
but the presidents own lies have frequently come under the microscope with twitter now flagging up trump tweets that are inaccurate

google pixel 4 able to photograph milky way
along with adding 2x optical zoom the second lens allows the pixel 4 to see in 3d thus doing a better job of blurring the background in portrait mode than previous pixel handsets which relied purely on software to achieve this bokeh effect
to establish the cameras credentials google brought legendary portrait photographer annie leibovitz on stage to talk about her experience shooting with the pixel 4 over the past 12 months
machine learning is still a strong focus for every aspect of googles new smartphones relying on computational photography to improve its hdr mode by combining up to nine different images
new dual exposure controls offer separate sliders for brightness and shadows allowing users to preview hdr in realtime
the phone also relies on machine learning for improved auto white balance and an enhanced night sight night mode which is sensitive enough to capture the milky way in the night sky
beyond the second camera lens the pixel 4 introduces a soli radar chip front sensor which recognises motion sense gestures allowing users to skip music dismiss timers snooze alarms or silence their phone with a wave of their hand
all motion sense computations run in the device rather than connecting to the internet as does the improved google assistant as the tech giant focused on both reducing response times and enhancing user privacy
googles continued push to make the most of its machine learning capabilities has also spawned a new voice recorder app which transcribes audio live without sending data to the internet
for now the app only supports in english with more languages to come
the pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support the google stadia cloud gaming platform which opens its doors on november 19 in the us but is yet to receive an australian launch date
beyond the new pixel handsets google also unveiled a new pixelbook go chromebook and secondgeneration google pixel buds
arriving next year but not confirmed for australia the new bluetooth 50 smart earbuds are completely wireless and feature adaptive audio which monitors your environment and continually adjusts the sound to provide optimal clarity
the new bluetooth 50 smart earbuds are completely wireless and adjust the sound to the noise levels around you
meanwhile google also announced an upgrade to its mesh wifi home routers in the nest wifi relying on a new separate router combined with several base stations working in unison to improve wireless coverage through the home
adopting the nest name the new wifi system doubles the range of its predecessor and adds a builtin microphone and speaker for using google assistant on each base station around the home
it launches in australia on november 5 for 399 with the router and one wifi point or 549 aud with a second wifi point
the google home mini also received an upgrade with the new 79 nest mini improving sound quality  doubling the bass  and adding an integrated wall mount
all google smart speakers are set to receive a new intercom feature for communicating between devices in the home plus the ability to call the nest mini from outside the home using the google home app
hurricane hanna coronavirushit texas faces new threat of catastrophic flooding in double whammy
forecasters are predicting catastrophic flooding in southern texas after hurricane hanna made landfall twice bringing heavy rain and winds up to 90mph
it came ashore on saturday as a category one storm the lowest of the five levels and has now been downgraded to a tropical storm  but there could still be 1530cm 612in of rain on sunday with 60mph winds
some areas have already reported getting up to 23cm 9in of rainfall including cameron county which borders mexico
hanna was the opening hurricane of the 2020 atlantic cyclone season and meteorologist chris birchfield warned residents to stay alert saying were not even close to over at this point  were still expecting catastrophic flooding
texas has already been dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks
governor greg abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in the storms path including harris fort bend galveston and brazoria
he said any hurricane is an enormous challenge
this challenge is complicated and made even more severe seeing that its sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for covid19
the first landfall happened at 5pm on saturday 15 miles north of port mansfield which is about 130 miles south of corpus christi
the second took place nearby in eastern kennedy county
more than 43700 people in south texas including corpus christi harlingen and brownsville were without power on saturday evening
emergency services in corpus christi have placed barricades near intersections so they are ready to use if streets flood
in a tweet president donald trump said his administration was monitoring hanna along with hurricane douglas which was heading toward hawaii in the pacific ocean
resident sherry boehme who lives along a beach in corpus christi said the approaching storm had increased the anxiety she felt during the pandemic
the 67yearold has mostly stayed at home because of health issues related to chronic lung disease
she said its almost like a double whammy to us
i think its made a lot of people nervous
well get through it
everybody is good and strong and sticks together
i dont want to be like mcgregor and show my money
im here to help people  chimaev after making history on ufc fight island  rt sport news
khamzat chimaev is being hailed as a ufc starinwaiting after making history on fight island but the russianborn fighter says he is not planning any ostentatious displays of wealth similar to the likes of conor mcgregor
chimaev overwhelmed northern irelands rhys mckee in their welterweight contest in abu dhabi on saturday night finishing his opponent with a groundandpound barrage 3 minutes and 9 seconds into the first round
the win ensured chimaev etched his name into the ufc history books by claiming the shortestever period between victories in the modern era of the promotion coming just 10 days after he defeated britains john phillips in similarly destructive fashion  on that occasion at middleweight
the 80 chimaev pocketed a 50000 performanceofthenight bonus for his work against mckee and has firmly earned the attention of the mma world being tipped as khabib 20  a perhaps inevitable comparison given chimaev displays a similar oppressive dominance to the ufc lightweight champ and was born in chechnya which neighbors khabibs own dagestani homeland
despite the newfound fame and financial boost the softlyspoken chimaev said he would not be prone to shows of wealth along the lines of mma moneyman conor mcgregor or his boxing equivalent floyd mayweather jr
i do this not only for me i do this for everybody i can help
i dont want to be like mayweather and mcgregor to show my money or something like that
i want to help people replied chimaev when asked on fight island about how he would spend his bonus
one man he has gained the attention of is conor mcgregor teammate and arch twitter protagonist dillon danis who took to the platform to claim he could submit chimaev easily
that drew a withering response from the fighter known as borz  or wolf in his native chechen  who said he would smash danis with his eyes closed
chimaev who now fights out of stockholm sweden having moved to the country at the age of 19 may be modest in displaying his financial ambitions but is distinctly less shy when it comes to his fighting prospects
i can smash everybody
how many fighters in the welterweight division
i can smash all of them he said
give me 77 kilos welterweight champion 84 kilos middleweight champion im going to smash both of them same day
home form vital for jose mourinho as boss says it will be easier for tottenham when fans return to stadiums
jose mourinho has helped tottenham hotspur start a new unbeaten run at home since the premier leagues restart but he says making that home form more consistent would be easier with supporters back
spurs have taken 12 wins from their home fixtures this term but were beaten four times  only one of the six teams above them lost more on home soil
the portuguese coach says its possible to build those important streaks while fans are absent but would be easier with them present
we need to do it with the fans without them you can create a kind of fortress but based on the tactical side of the game he said
but i think with fans you can do it in a much stronger way because you add the emotional side of the game that only your fans in your stadium can give to you
mourinho feels that achieving the kind of long unbeaten streaks on home soil which he enjoyed at chelsea or which liverpool have built over the past three seasons is becoming ever tougher as the opposition becomes stronger
but its also a crucial factor in determining whether sides achieve their respective objectives at the end of the season particularly in closefought or derby matches where a home atmosphere can make the difference
i think the premier league is getting into a direction where these unbeaten records are something more and more difficult to achieve because of the level of the teams
but to be strong at home and to arrive at the end of each season with an important number of points in your pocket from home matches is very important
i think our recent results at home without the fans are important but we need them back
i can imagine that victory against arsenal with the stadium full of tottenham fans
this is the kind of empathy that you can create step by step

the turnabout didnt go unnoticed as conservatives ridiculed gallant for his earlier view tweeting messages such as just chill dawg and huh maybe trump was right
jason rantz another seattle radio host said guess were finally doing that field trip we discussed
gallant acknowledged the humor woke up to a bunch of people tweeting chill dawg at me  i laughed
he said he stood by his earlier statement as he had walked through the chaz autonomous zone created by anarchists and found it to be less bad than it was portrayed

poland to withdraw from european treaty aimed at preventing violence towards women
polands rightwing government says it will withdraw from a european treaty aimed at preventing violence against women
the istanbul convention is the worlds first binding instrument to prevent violence against women but the polish justice minister zbigniew ziobro described the text as harmful because it requires that schools teach children about gender from a sociological point of view
ziobro said over the weekend that on monday he will begin preparing the formal process to withdraw from the treaty
this ideological element is linked to the imperative to change education in schools and outside of school programs in terms of learning attitudes convictions of the young polish generation of students to make in our opinion the false assumption that biological sex is archaic and in fact everything comes down to the sociocultural gender
in ziobros opinion the conventions articles concerning the education of children and young people as well as family relationships in the lgbt context are not acceptable
we also reject the lgbt element of promoting family relationships a view propagated by activists from leftwing or homosexual circles who want to translate their beliefs into binding law he said
the council of europe said on sunday it is alarmed that poland is aiming to withdraw from the convention
in warsaw on friday around 2000 people including womens groups and other rights activists held a demonstration in front of the offices of ordo luris a rightwing organisation that supports withdrawal from the convention
we will not be victims they chanted
demonstrations were also held in other polish cities
poland signed the istanbul convention for the prevention and combating of violence against women and domestic violence in december 2012 and ratified it in 2015

heart attack eating chocolate once a week may reduce risk of the deadly condition
new research has pinpointed a certain indulgence may be good for the heart muscle
what is it  and how would it reduce the chances of a heart attack
researchers conducted a metaanalysis spanning five decades looking into coronary heart disease chd
chd  that also goes by the name of ischaemic heart disease  has three main symptoms chest pain angina heart attacks and heart failure
other symptoms of the disease can include heart palpitations and unusual breathlessness
chocolate contains hearthealthy nutrients such as flavonoids methylxanthines polyphenols and stearic acid which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol
good cholesterol otherwise known as highdensity lipoprotein hdl collects bad cholesterol  the kind that furs up the hearts arteries  and transports it to the liver
in the liver bad lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol is broken down and excreted from the body
however the new study doesnt examine portion sizes or the type of chocolate enjoyed
its not clear whether the participants ate dark chocolate milk chocolate or some other cocoa confectionery
the findings were based on previous research that concluded that consuming cocoa found in chocolate reduced the risk of a heart attack
its believed by scientists the flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function
vascular function refers to how effectively the blood delivers oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and carries away waste material
in regards to the new research lifestyle factors werent highlighted in the results
dr alice lichtenstein commented on the data suggesting that those who admitted to eating chocolate may be more likely to have a healthy body weight
she added that they could regularly engage in physical exercise and be less stressed
she continued each factor could independently impact on cardiovascular health
rep val demings talks vp candidacy blasts trump for pardons
congresswoman val demings dfla was not shy about her willingness to serve as vice president under a potential joe biden administration as well as her sincere appreciation for being considered for the role
in a live interview with blackpressusa as part of its fiyah  live series the esteemed member of the congressional black caucus shared her history and the work ethic and commitment that has brought her to this point stating you all know my history  i grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor in jacksonville florida
demings served as one of seven house impeachment managers during the january trial of president donald trump in the senate
regardless of the senate acquittal history will forever note that he is the fourth commanderinchief to be impeached
the former house impeachment manager replied in a february interview with npr from her capitol hill office was it worth it  every day it has been worth it
adding while the verdict was disappointing democrats had an obligation to pursue the case regardless of outcome
during the interview demings made it clear that she objects to trump commuting the prison sentence of roger stone who was convicted of lying to congress among other felonies as well as his pardoning of other felons convicted of similar crimes stating the gall of pardoning your friends those who lied and cheated to cover up for your wrongdoings
demings heads bidens list of potential running mates along with cbc chair karen bass dcalif former georgia state rep stacey abrams sens kamala harris dcalif and tammy duckworth dillinois atlanta mayor keisha lance bottoms former us ambassador susan rice and a few others
she noted however that just one person will decide who will run alongside joe biden this fall
thats joe biden
then while laughing she raised her hand to her lips in a mock whisper to those viewing the livestream adding if yall want to make a call go ahead
theres no doubt that regardless of ones political leanings history will look back on this period as a season of evolution in american politics and perceptions
this fact was not lost on demings
she noted that having so any women in consideration for vice presidential candidacy represents an opportunity to break through what remains of the glass ceiling  particularly when it comes to african american women
these are the exact opportunities that i work hard for all of my life to create for young boys and girls who may have been told theyre the wrong color dont have enough money or are the wrong gender she said
the congresswoman pledged to make sure that the democratic national committee and the biden campaign advertise and to work with the black press of america to get as many as possible out to vote
i will make a call to dnc head tom perez and i will put this on the top of my list demings promised
she agreed it should be done now rather than later in the campaign
responding to former secretary of state hillary clintons suggestion that trump might refuse to leave the white house if defeated and a separate editorial stating that the president is positioning to pardon himself demings became animated to even suggest pardoning himself made me sick to my stomach
but who would ever do that other than trump
i think he hates the job
its not a job where you should be allowed to break the law and ignore the constitution
i think he hates the job but he hates to lose
i can see this president not wanting to leave the white house but we have a way of taking care of that and if that happens i just want to be on the team that makes it happen
judge denies attempt to stop order requiring release of children in immigration custody
in a saturday ruling judge dolly gee appeared to make the upcoming deadline moot by saying that us immigration and customs enforcement doesnt have to release children if the three ways outlined in her previous order cant be met
but gee also underscored in her order that ice still has a duty to release children in a timely manner
the three ways gee had outlined included releasing families who are in ice detention together releasing children to a sponsor or releasing families based upon a federal court order
shalyn fluharty director of proyecto dilley an organization that offers legal services to families in detention decried the move as allowing ice to decide whether to continue keeping children detained
the bottom line for me is that kids are detained indefinitely and they have no way out unless ice agrees to do it or families agree to be separated fluharty said
families are detained in three facilities run by ice  berks in pennsylvania south texas dilley and karnes county in texas
children at the facilities range from ages 1 to 17 according to lawyers and advocates who provide legal assistance
gee  who oversees implementation of the flores agreement which governs care of children in custody  said in june that given noncompliance or spotty compliance with masking and social distancing rules it was imperative to transfer children out of the facilities
there are 969 detainees in ice custody with positive coronavirus cases who are under isolation or monitoring as of july 23 according to ice
of those there are 25 confirmed cases in karnes and one in dilley two of the family detention centers
overall there have been more than 3700 confirmed cases in custody

prince harry news duke of sussexs friend lashes out at explosive claims in new book
mr stott told sky news that prince harry and meghan markle that the content within the book was no different to that in tabloids other than it was in a hardback
the former soldier called for more focus on the good the couple do including their charity work
mr stott said i think what we are reading here is no different from what we have read in the tabloids it is now just on a hardback
you have got an authors persona it is still not guaranteed that it has come from them
i just think it is another sort of attack like the tabloids trying to persecute them
i understand they are in the public eye and people wish to know what they are doing but i wish the focus was more on the good that they do and the charity work rather than their intimate privacies
but because of who they are they will never get away from that of course

they had a small wedding but still the coverage of harry and meghans wedding even though it was smaller was still as big as williams and kates because there is a worldwide fascination with them

gottlieb warns uncontrolled coronavirus spread in a community makes it very hard to open schools in fall
washington  dr scott gottlieb former head of the food and drug administration warned sunday its going to be very hard for school districts to open for the upcoming academic year if there is uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus within their communities
for local school districts i think they need to be looking at what is the spread within the community
if you have uncontrolled spread within the community its going to be very hard to open against that backdrop gottlieb said on face the nation
with the fall semester set to begin in the coming weeks the trump administration had been urging school districts to open their doors to students for inperson instruction five days a week
but the push from president trump and education secretary betsy devos comes as mr trump warned last week the coronavirus crisis will likely get worse before it gets better and acknowledged school districts in hot spots may have to delay reopening for a few weeks
still the centers for disease control and prevention issued guidance thursday for how best to safely open schools for students
the guidance calls for schools to follow social distancing recommend students and staff wear face coverings and keep students in defined groups to reduce contact with others among other guidelines
but the cdc did not provide a benchmark for school administrators on when they should move to close a school in the event of an uptick in coronavirus infections which gottlieb said was unfortunate
in the setting of uncertainty and the lack of specific guidance for how to keep schools open i think more parents are going to err on the side of caution he said
thats why its very important to get specificity out of what the hard metrics are that the cdc didnt do in its guidance
gottlieb said school districts should think about positivity rates in their community local spread and testing capacity to guide decisionmaking on whether to keep a school open or shift fully to online learning
a positivity rate between 5 to 10 he said is starting to get iffy while above 10 is the threshold where you really want to think carefully about closing the school districts
that is a sign that there is an epidemic underway inside that community gottlieb said adding that its going to be difficult for parts of florida which is an epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the us to open their schools for inperson learning next month
more than 30 states and the district of columbia are experiencing an uptick in coronavirus infections with the epicenter of the epidemic currently in the sun belt
but gottlieb said there are indications cases in some states including arizona and texas are beginning to plateau
while gottlieb said there are unmistakable signs the epidemic is slowing in some states across the sun belt its heating up in others including south carolina alabama indiana and illinois
many governors have instituted mandates requiring people to wear masks when they are in public spaces and halted their phased reopenings in an effort to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus
gottlieb said states should consider shutting down bars limiting the number of people in restaurants closing movie theaters and other kinds of indoor entertainment venues and implementing mask mandates to quell the epidemic steps that allow states to stop short of reverting back to the more stringent restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic in march
in addition to states issuing mask mandates a number of businesses are requiring customers to wear face coverings as well
mcdonalds is among the latest to require face coverings and the fast food giant joins walmart starbucks and others in implementing their own rules for masks
gottlieb said he expects more businesses will implement mask mandates in venues especially those considered highrisk
if we really can manage to keep the epidemic under control heading into the winter until we get to a vaccine or some kind of therapeutic that changes the clinical trajectory of this illness just with masks thats going to be something relatively simple that we can all do that doesnt really change our lives and allows us to maintain whats really important to us like keeping some businesses open like getting our kids back to school he said
while mr trump has said he will not impose a nationwide mask mandate he urged americans last week to wear coverings saying during a white house press briefing they have an impact

coles ditches plastic toys for books in new collectibles campaign
weve really listened and it was a really key thing in formulating this program ms ronson said
we dont think people will want to recycle the books  we think theyll want to keep them but they can recycle them at home if they wish to
ms ronson said the new campaign had been in the works long before the onset of covid19 and despite the pandemic she believed the timing was quite good for a new campaign given the amount of time parents were spending with their children
analysts had been concerned shoppers were tiring of the constant collectibles campaigns from major supermarkets but ms ronson said there was no sign of fatigue just yet
were not seeing any of that so far but we do constantly look out for it she said
we analyse a lot of data week to week month to month to make sure were launching things that really resonate with the customer base
collectible campaigns such as little shop were primarily pioneered by coles in australia with the first iteration launching in mid2018 fuelling one of the supermarkets bestever singlequarter sales results
woolworths has since followed suit with its lion king ooshies campaign which also helped the supermarket supercharge its sales and most recently its ecofriendly discovery garden promotion which offered customer free herbs and flowers to plant
however with ubs analysts predicting australias supermarket sector to have covidinflated sales through much of the 2021 financial year the impact of coles new collectibles could be far more muted this time
ms ronson said customers could expect more varied and diverse forms of collectibles campaigns into the future with promotions such as little shop likely to appear less often
theres a lot of these collectibletype campaigns to look to around the world and were constantly drawing inspiration from overseas she said
we should be doing those sorts of things to make sure were constantly raising the bar with our own customer base

the seal made an attempt to get the fishing line he said
the angler finished his beer drained the bottle and threw it at the seal
the bottle hit the seal on the back and it swam off
mr kenny said that fortunately seals are robust creatures but said the seal was simply doing what was in its nature
by throwing a glass bottle at it you are stopping it from hunting he said
the seal project said it was not an isolated case and it had received numerous reports of this aggressive behaviour recently
in a facebook post it said volunteers had collected 12 bags of rubbish during sundays visit to hopes nose and observed multiple examples of antisocial behaviour
all seals are protected under the conservation of seals act and people are advised to stay away from them
tory mps accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to stay at home forever
tory mps accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to stay at home forever after defying boris johnsons call for them to get back into the office
union chiefs were last night accused of wanting staff to stay at home forever after defying boris johnsons clarion call for workers to get back to the office
tory mps reacted with anger after the public and commercial services union told their members to challenge bosses who ordered them back to their desks
former minister andrew percy said it was unacceptable that vital publicsector work such as issuing passports was going undone while private employees had toiled to keep the country going during the coronavirus crisis
its unacceptable for them to refuse to come back to work while people in distribution centres and factories around the country have continued to go to work to feed civil servants during this period he said
many of those workers would now like a holiday and cant have one because of this refusal to go back to work in offices which can be achieved safely
the union chiefs cannot have a policy of stay at home forever  especially not now that we know people can return to work safely
following the prime ministers call alex chisholm the civil services new chief operating officer last week told all ministries that it was time to change the default that civil servants should work from home and accelerate the return to the workplace from august 1
but the public and commercial services union told its 200000 members they did not have to accept that guidance claiming it was a political issue
a spokesman for the pcs britains largest civil service union said the backtotheoffice demand is not based on our members health and safety or on helping our economy
it is based entirely on political pressure being exerted by some tory mps who are demanding that the civil service is used as an example to get everybody back to work
our advice to members is clear if you are working from home and you get approached by anyone in your department asking you to now go back to work dont just accept thats what you have to do
the dispute comes amid growing concerns over delays to passports caused by homeworking with more than 400000 people now said to be waiting for their applications to be processed
the home office has now said it will seek to expedite applications from britons due to travel within the next 14 days and who have been waiting on the passport office for more than four weeks
the pcs has admitted that some people are having to wait for as long as 143 days for passports but insists that small and often cramped offices make social distancing difficult for the passport offices 4000 staff
former cabinet minister david davis urged civil service union chiefs to behave responsibly and work with the government to find way of getting people back to their workplaces
he added that if he was in government he would be asking union leaders what are you suggesting that you stay at home all summer
however mr johnsons plea to get people back to their offices has also gone unheeded by some of britains top firms
a study of big employers with a total of 400000 staff between them found that only about 40000 of them have returned to the workplace
