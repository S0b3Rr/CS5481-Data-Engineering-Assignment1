She emphasized that such voluntary and charitable activities, stemming from the two countries' enduring partnership, have resulted in multifaceted socio-economic benefits for Ethiopians.\nCalling for further strengthening the two countries' cooperation in social protection and voluntary services, the minister said China's experience in social protection offers valuable lessons for Ethiopia.\nTesfaye also underscored the need to further bolster the people-to-people ties between Ethiopia and China through strategic partnerships in such fields as social protection, voluntary services, education, and capacity building.\nBilateral relations between the two countries have seen new heights in recent years.\nIn October 2023, China and Ethiopia announced the elevation of their ties to an all-weather strategic partnership during Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's visit to Beijing. Abiy also attended the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in early September. \u25a0"}
