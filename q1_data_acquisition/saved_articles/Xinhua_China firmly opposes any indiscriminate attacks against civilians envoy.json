This is nothing short of a mockery of international justice and the authority of international law.\"\nThe ambassador emphasized that the Middle East \"cannot afford another war,\" and that it is imperative to stop military adventurism and facilitate deescalation.\nHe took note of the efforts by the international community, including the appeal of the UN secretary-general, the mediation efforts by the world body, and Lebanon's willingness to seek a diplomatic solution, and urged Israel to \"make the right decision, put aside its obsession with the use of force, stop its military operations in Gaza, stop its violations of Lebanon's sovereignty and security, and stop adventurous acts that could drag the region into a new catastrophe.\"\nFu also called on all relevant parties to exercise maximum restraint and to avoid escalating the situation.\nUnderscoring the Security Council's responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, he urged all council members to demonstrate political will and leadership for peace, respond to the expectations of Lebanon and Arab states, and support the council in taking strong, necessary actions without delay, in order to play an effective role in stopping the war and easing the situation. \u25a0"}
