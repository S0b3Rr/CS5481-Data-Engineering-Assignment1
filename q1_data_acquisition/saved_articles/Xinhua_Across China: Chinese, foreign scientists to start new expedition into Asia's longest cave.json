It is also the world's longest dolomite cave.\nFrench caver Jean Bottazzi, who has more than three decades of cave exploration experience in China, is acting as chief of the upcoming cave research. He calls Shuanghe Cave his second home.\nHe said that since the late 1980s, the discoveries of Chinese and foreign experts in the cave have led to repeated updates of the cave's length, and many cave fossils and living organisms have been unearthed, providing rich, valuable scientific research materials.\nDuring this year's scientific expedition, Suiyang County, which administers the cave area, will hold activities such as a geological science photography contest and a short video contest to promote the cave geopark. \u25a0\nThis undated file photo shows a concert held in the Shuanghe Cave, Asia's longest known cave, in Suiyang County, southwest China's Guizhou Province.
