Two other Americans, Mark Swidan and Kai Li, are considered to be unjustly imprisoned by the State Department. Swidan is currently on death row for alleged drug trafficking.All are said to be experiencing health issues. China does not recognise dual nationality, meaning people who hold both an American and Chinese passport are regarded as Chinese citizens by Beijing."}
