This was her seizing the initiative, and a telling sign that America\u2019s surprise presidential candidate was keen to exert control on an opponent who has a track record of dominating these kind of stages.In the hours since this blockbuster showdown, political pundits and networks have dedicated much time to praising and analysing Harris\u2019s approach. Her poking and her prodding of Trump. Her mocking, derisory laughter as she ribbed him with personal attacks and then watched as he lost his cool and pushed back angrily.The scale and tone of this coverage is largely due to the fact her strategy was successful. The few instant polls we saw after the debate indicated a resounding victory for Harris. And while the history of US elections shows this does not always translate to a victory in November, it was surprising to see Harris take on Trump in this aggressive way.But, however successful this approach was, it is ultimately surface-level stuff. It is body language and facial expressions and sharp ripostes.Before this event, polls consistently suggested voters wanted to know more about where Harris stood on the key issues. Her campaign so far has been light, even vague, on hard policy. And while Trump is more well-established, voters are surely still keen to know what he would do in real terms if elected again.So, did the debate tell us much about what either of them would do in office? Not particularly.Harris did come with prepared soundbites explaining her economic proposals that she has outlined before \u2013 a $6,000 child tax credit for infants, a $50,000 tax cut for small businesses and $25,000 to help first time home buyers find a deposit. She argued that Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on imported goods would cause higher prices for consumers.These are all things we have heard several times previously from the campaign.Harris did not give an answer when quizzed on why the Biden administration, which she has served in for almost four years, has kept in place a number of tariffs introduced by Trump. Nor did she describe how she would try to tackle inflation which consistently polls as a top concern for many voters.But Trump\u2019s attempt to capitalise on this clear and obvious weakness for Harris (he described his rival\u2019s economic policies as Marxist) got lost as he veered into an answer about illegal migrants, saying \u201cbad immigration\u201d is the worst thing that can happen to the economy.This exchange was illustrative of the night as a whole. There was no shortage of heat in this ill-tempered debate, but both sides shone very little light on policy.GLOBAL REACTION: What the world thoughtFACT-CHECK: Key claims from both sides examinedANALYSIS: Harris puts Trump on the defensiveVOTER REACTION: Undecided Americans impressed by HarrisThe Trump campaign is eager to paint Harris as a radical left-winger by reminding voters that she has previously said she would ban fracking, nationalise health insurance and decriminalise illegal border crossings.Asked directly why so many of her policy positions have changed, Harris said she would discuss every point raised \u2013 but in reality explained only why she voted for new fracking leases to reduce dependence on foreign oil. Once again, a flustered Trump failed to capitalise on her policy flip flops being raised directly.These were easy opportunities to sell himself as consistent on policy in comparison. He could have rammed home his positions on the key issues as well as tout policy achievements from his first term. Instead, viewers saw the former president on the defensive, distracted by barbs from Harris which he could have chosen to ignore.It was immigration that he returned to again and again. His signature issue which he believes is more salient now than ever. Yet, even on such comfortable ground. he could not describe how he would go about trying to deport millions of illegal migrants. There was more familiar noise but still little in the way of hard proposals.This debate was the first chance voters had to see the two candidates going head to head. They could compare demeanour, temperament and body language. But crucially they didn\u2019t get much to compare on their plans for government.One moment on Tuesday night felt particularly indicative of this.For nine years, Trump has been saying he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) but had to admit that he has not produced a plan for what could replace it. \u201cI have the concepts of a plan\u201d was his response.And after the 90-minute primetime showdown, voters were likely only left with \u201cthe concepts\u201d of what either of these candidates would do if elected to the White House."}
