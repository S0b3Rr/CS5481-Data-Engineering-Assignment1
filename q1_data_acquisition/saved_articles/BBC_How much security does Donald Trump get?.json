{"title": "How much security does Donald Trump get?", "meta": {"time": "17 September 2024", "author": "Jake Horton & Lucy GilderBBC Verify"}, "content": "The Biden administration has asked Congress for special permission to increase spending on the Secret Service, warning that without it, the service would have \"insufficient resources\" to enhance its protective operations.The request follows what authorities have said was a second apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump, with further questions being asked about Secret Service protection of the former president and Republican presidential candidate. We don\u2019t know the exact number of agents who are assigned to the former president, but according to Ronald Kessler, an author who specialises in the Secret Service, about 80 would be assigned to Trump at any one time.About 300 agents are assigned to the sitting president and vice-president, compared to the 90 to 100 who protect a former president, Mr Kessler said. These totals include all staff, which means Trump would not have that many agents with him in every instance. \u201cThe shift detail is always the same - this is the close protection officers near the president - but then there\u2019s counter-sniper teams, counter-assault teams, counter-surveillance teams,\u201d said Michael Matranga, who worked at the Secret Service for 12 years under Barack Obama.On a day-to-day basis, former presidents wouldn\u2019t have those additional teams, but Trump does, according to Mr Matranga.\u201cMore can still be done. It would be good to have dogs sweeping bushes or an emergency response team scanning the area,\u201d he said.\u201cBut people need to understand that the Secret Service need to find a balance where the president can engage with constituents or enjoy a round of golf. They can\u2019t just keep him in a bulletproof box,\u201d Mr Matranga added.Former Secret Service agent Jason Russell told the BBC that the service was in charge of the area in the immediate vicinity of the former president. But he added that local law enforcement would be in charge of the outer perimeter of a public space, like the golf course.The Secret Service ramped up security before the first assassination attempt after receiving intelligence of an Iranian plot to kill Trump - and has further increased its staffing since then.During a hearing following the Pennsylvania attempt, the acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told lawmakers they were expanding the use of drones to check areas, improving communication and increasing the number of security agents.BBC Verify has asked the Secret Service how many more agents were given to Trump\u2019s security detail following the first assassination attempt but the agency has not yet responded.Mr Russell said that he had noticed \u201cthe number of agents and the number of assets that has been given to former president Trump has certainly increased\u201d.\u201cOnce he became the nominee obviously that protection goes up to another level, where you start to get additional assets\u2026 but certainly not the level a sitting president or vice-president would have,\u201d he added.The Washington Post has reported that senior officials at the Secret Service repeatedly rejected requests for additional protection from Trump\u2019s security team in the two years leading up to the attempt on his life in July. Although the agency initially denied that such requests were made, it later acknowledged that some requests from Trump's security detail may have been rejected.On Monday, the acting head of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, said security around Mr Trump's home was now as intense as when he was president.He said he was being provided with the \"highest level\" of security.The Secret Service had a total budget of $3.1bn in the 2024 financial year. This was 9% higher than the previous year\u2019s budget.Just over $1bn of this was allocated to \u201cProtection of Persons and Facilities\u201d.The service has around 8,000 staff in total, including special agents, administrative and technical personnel.Nearly half (3,671) work full-time in Protective Operations.A decade ago, there were 4,027 people assigned to protect the president and other senior officials, according to NBC News.\u201cThe whole budget of the Secret Service is about the same as one stealth bomber,\u201d Mr Kessler said.\u201cThe whole agency is suffering with a lack of money and staff,\u201d he added.As well as the government's request to increase spending in the coming weeks, the Secret Service has separately told Congress that it needs more resources to carry out its duties. What do we know about suspect Ryan Wesley Routh?Analysis: Political violence becomes America's new normWhat we know about the incident so farFull story: Suspect held and Trump rushed to safety\u201cThe biggest question I have is not about the Secret Service\u2019s reaction, but how the suspect knew Trump was going to be on the golf course at that time,\u201d Mr Matranga told us. It isn\u2019t yet known how the suspect knew of Trump's whereabouts on Sunday.BBC Verify has been looking through Trump's recent posts on social media and he did not say that he would be playing golf at his West Palm Beach course at the time and date the assassination attempt took place.Following a rally in Las Vegas on Friday, Trump\u2019s campaign schedule mentions no other events until a town hall speech in Michigan on 17 September.CNN has also quoted from sources who claim Trump\u2019s visit to the golf course was a last-minute addition to his schedule.However, it would be reasonable to assume Trump could be in Mar-a-Lago at the weekend, given how frequently he travels there. He also posted on X (on 12 September) that he would be hosting a \"State of Crypto Address\" on the evening of 16 September from Mar-a-Lago.Trump has often been filmed and photographed with members of the public at his golf course, such as in this Instagram post from July 2024.Additional reporting by Joshua Cheetham and Kumar Malhotra."}
