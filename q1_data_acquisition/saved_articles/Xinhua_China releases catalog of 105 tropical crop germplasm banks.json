In 2008, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs launched a project to protect these resources.\nHuang noted that the release of the catalog aims to improve the germplasm banks and facilitate the transformation and application of scientific and technological achievements in the seed industry, providing significant guidance for the future of China's tropical crop seed sector.  \u25a0"}
