Samples are being collected to assess if the products meet the FSSAI standards for chemical residue, as mandated by law,\" media reports quoting officials said.\nLast week, Singapore recalled an Indian-made fish curry spice blend namely Everest Fish Curry Masala over the presence of exceeding levels of ethylene oxide in it.\n\"The Center for Food Safety in Hong Kong has issued a notification on the recall of Everest Fish Curry Masala from India due to the presence of ethylene oxide at levels exceeding permissible limit,\" Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said in a media release.\n\"As the implicated products were imported into Singapore, the SFA has directed the importer, Sp Muthiah & Sons Pte. Ltd., to recall the products.\"\nMeanwhile, India's spice exports regulator Spices Board of India is looking into the ban imposed by Hong Kong and Singapore on the sale of some spices-mix products\nThe Spices Board of India has asked MDH and Everest to provide details of quality checks. \u25a0"}
